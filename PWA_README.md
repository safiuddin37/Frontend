## Troubleshooting

### App Not Installing
- Ensure you're using a supported browser
- Check that the site is served over HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Offline Not Working
- Check if service worker is registered in DevTools > Application
- Verify cache is populated in DevTools > Application > Storage
- Try refreshing the page

### Updates Not Showing
- The app checks for updates automatically
- You'll be prompted to reload when a new version is available
- You can also manually check for updates by refreshing

## Security Notes

- PWA requires HTTPS in production
- Service worker has limited access to sensitive data
- All API calls still go through your existing backend
- No backend logic has been modified

## Customization

Replace `src/assets/favicon-logo.png` with your desired icon (recommended sizes: 192x192, 512x512)

### Updating App Name
Edit the `name` and `short_name` fields in `public/manifest.json`

### Modifying Cache Strategy
